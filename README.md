# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether a bank customer will leave (churn) or stay using machine learning techniques. It helps banks proactively identify customers at risk of leaving, allowing timely retention strategies.

##  Overview

The notebook explores various classification algorithms including:
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Gradient Boosting Classifier (GB)

###  Best Performing Model
- **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy of **85.47%**
- Gradient Boosting also performed well with **82.36% accuracy**

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy

##  File Structure
- `Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing all code and outputs

##  How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file
2. Open it using Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab
3. Run the cells sequentially to see results
